# From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The project creates a Google Search and Results Page. I built an HTML and CSS files that contained the structure and design of the page.  I used the developer tools extensively to help build my pages and to debug the site. I referenced Google and other instructional sites for guidance. I also experimented which is why it took my longer than I had anticipated.
